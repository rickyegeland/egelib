`egelib` -- Ricky Egeland's Analysis Toolkit
============================================

This is a collection of functions I have found useful while performing
data analyses with python for astronomy and solar physics.  I have
tried to categorize functions into modules with a common theme, but
the overall idea here is to collect everything I have found useful,
not to create a comprehensive library to solve a particular class of
problems.

Installation and Requirements
-----------------------------

The following packages are required:

 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * astropy
 * py.test

List of Modules
---------------
 * analysis : Generic data processing routines
 * stats : Generic statistics routines
 * timeseries : Time series analysis, e.g. spectral analysis
